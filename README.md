# 🪨 Monolith
Monolith is an autonomous single-collateral CDP stablecoin factory on EVM chains: each deployment yields an isolated triplet of Lender, Coin (ERC20 stablecoin), and Vault (ERC4626 staking). The Lender is the core engine: it manages positions (collateral and debt), accrues interest on the paid-debt pool, runs liquidations and write-offs, and handles redemptions and optional PSM buy/sell. Debt is split into two pools—free (redeemable, 0% rate) and paid (non-redeemable, variable rate)—with a band-based target free-debt ratio driving the borrow rate via exponential convergence and a closed-form integral for interest. The optional Peg Stability Module allows 1:1 swaps between Coin and a reference asset, either held directly or via an ERC4626 vault. Redemptions let users exchange Coin for collateral at oracle price minus a configurable fee, repaying free-debt borrowers pro-rata. Liquidations enforce a collateral-factor check and a dynamic incentive; write-offs socialize bad debt across both debt pools. The Factory deploys triplets with CREATE3, uses a shared stateless InterestModel for all Lenders, and relies on Chainlink-compatible oracles with staleness handling and a 24-hour unwind. Access is time-limited (immutability deadline); after that, key parameters and PSM buy are locked while fee and governance hooks remain operator-controlled.
